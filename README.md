This is the repository for heatherstonehoa.com.

##ToDo List:

Items below should be done eventually but they are in no particular order.

1. Add .gitignore on images and files. Probs need to set up Dropbox to serve these on the web server for now
1. Add an .htacess file so that we can remove file extensions (won't break existing saved links)
1. Add a favicon
1. Google Analytics
1. Compile / Minify CSS
1. Compile / Minify JS
1. Put the site on a CMS
1. Set up file / DB backups -- maybe push to Dropbox or Google Drive


## Long Term Goals

1. Set up a mailing list
1. Set up a calendar (integrate with Google Calendar ideally)
1. Train other board members to become content editors (after CMS)
